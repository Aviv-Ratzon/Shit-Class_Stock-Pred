# StockPredMutualInfo

This is a POC tool ment to check the mutual information between a stock and group of other stocks. 

We can divide the workflow into 2 main steps:
1. Pencil stroke generation (captures the general strucure of the scene)
2. Pencil tone drawing (captures shapes shadows and shading)

Combining the results from these steps should yield the desired result. The workflow can be depicted as follows:

* Both figures were taken from the original paper

# Usage
1. Fill in group names and stock names in /config/StockNames.csv
2. Fill in group names and stock symbols in /config/StockSymbols.csv (in accordance with StockNames.csv)
3. Edit config/config.py, mainly RUN_CONFIG:
4. 
# Parameters
* kernel_size = size of the line segement kernel (usually 1/30 of the height/width of the original image)
* stroke_width = thickness of the strokes in the Stroke Map (0, 1, 2)
* num_of_directions = stroke directions in the Stroke Map (used for the kernels)
* smooth_kernel = how the image is smoothed (Gaussian Kernel - "gauss", Median Filter - "median")
* gradient_method = how the gradients for the Stroke Map are calculated (0 - forward gradient, 1 - Sobel)
* rgb = True if the original image has 3 channels, False if grayscale
* w_group = 3 possible weight groups (0, 1, 2) for the histogram distribution, according to the paper (brighter to darker)
* pencil_texture_path = path to the Pencil Texture Map to use (4 options in "./pencils", you can add your own)
* stroke_darkness = 1 is the same, up is darker.
* tone_darkness = as above
